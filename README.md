LanguageListCreator
===================

Tool has 3 parts - currently only in Spanish:

*Dictionary - rudimentary checking for verbs, can be improved

*Translator - translates using wordreference API + condenses output

*ListCreator - creates (currently random) lists of words

usage currently restricted to modular. setup.py file included

get_list.py produces a prettified table of sample output
